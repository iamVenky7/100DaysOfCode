Serving a Website ( Hosting & Deployment)

What is "Website Hosting" or "Deployment"?

*Deploying a Website*: Moving the Website code onto a remote machine ("server") that serves the site to visitors

Hosting: The remote machine ("server") hosts (stores) the website code and serves it to visitors.

If a website should be visible to other people, it needs to be hosted/deployed
 [ A remote machine ("server" ) holds the website code and sends it to browser that sent a request to that remote machine]

Relative vs Absolute Paths

Relative Path : images/my-image.jpg  --> Look for files and folders RELATIVE FROM THE SOURCE FILE (i.e. the file that contains this Path)

Absolute Path : /images/my-image.jpg --> Look for files and folders RELATIVE FROM THE ROOT FOLDER (i.e. the main project folder that is being served)



    GIT & GITHUB

Efficient code Management with version control 

> Understanding Version Management/Version control
> Getting Started with Git Repositories, Commits & More
> Collaborating in Git Projects with GitHub Remote Repositories, Clone, Pull Requests & More


initial code --- --- --- --- --- --->  Latest code

Efficient CONTROL & TRACKING of  CODE CHANGES* over time.

GIT : 0)Local tool on your computer.
      1) Version control for web development Projects.
      2)Organozed in "Repositories"

GitHub: 0)Cloud Hosting provider for "Git Repositories"
        1)Collaborating in & contribution to web development Projects
        2)The world's largest development platform   



Human Computer Interaction

GUI   vs   CLI


CLI -- Fastest and Most common way to Efficiently work with GIT & GITHUB.

cmd--
 
 dir -- directory shows all  in( users )

 in directory there are 3 
 home-
 users- general 1 user dir in c  --cd ..
 root- c drive  cd ..   cd /

 cd .. move 2 directories up

changing harddisk drive  - D:

above for back i.e, up
so  what to go for home --
  generally Absolute and Relative Path 
  Absolute always starts from our   ( root directory ) -- cd (folder name)--- C:\Users\venka>cd OneDrive

  Relative --  starts from current location

  cls -- clear screen

 mkdir  -- make directory 
  mkdir command-prompt

  to create files--[  echo our first file > test.txt      ]  -- type test.txt
  to delete file del test.txt  del test.txt   or    rmdir (name of dir)


Git Basics - Theory

in git manage project --  developer -> Working Directory , current project folder
                      --  Repository -  All tracked files and folders
                      [ Commit (code snapshot )- "add image"  , " fixed order button"] | [Branch (where commits are stored ) - main/master, feature]



git Basics

git init -- to intialize the git -- master branch   ,  git branch -m <name>
git status -- we see info about our curent git project
   -- Untracked files there 
git add <file name>
git config --global -- edit  --> to know recent commits by whom  esc:x ( exit)

git config --global user.name or email    -- to add in Commits

git log --  to see commits and updated commits by author and date
