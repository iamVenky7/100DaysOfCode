saves all elements as JavaScript objects. --->         the DOM and extract data from it or manipulate it. */

THE DOM TREE

document --head & body--> h1 & p --> a

Selecting DOM Elements
----------------

"Drill into Elements" - document.body.children[0].firstChild --> You have to know the DOM Structure and if it changes, your code needs to change as well
Query Elements  - document.getElementById('some-id);  document.querySelector('.some-class');   --> Selecting elements works like in CSS and hence no exact DOM Structure knowledge is required.


if you know that you want to get access to the firsr child element of another element, you can use either of these 2 types.
1).children[0]
2) .firstElementChild
