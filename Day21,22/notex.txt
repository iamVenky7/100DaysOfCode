   -- Hard to manage due to casacading nature

rem --  Size is Relative to root element's fontsize
    -- Prefered choice if applicable

0.1em = 4px

% always refers to the parent element
em & rem relate  to font size

Getting Started with Media Queries

Media Query is a CSS code 

@media(min width or max width:1200px){
            p{
      font-size: 2rem;
   }
}

Desktop First -- max-width
Mobile First -- min-width
